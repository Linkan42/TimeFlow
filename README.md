## Stack MERN

 The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) provides a robust and scalable foundation for building full-stack web applications. We also incorporate Material-UI (MUI) into our web application, to enhance the frontend user interface with beautifully designed Material Design components, ensuring a modern and intuitive user experience.

### MongoDB

 MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It's known for its scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. We use MongoDB to store our users, meetings and more.

### ExpressJS

 Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It acts as a backend framework for TimeFlow, handling HTTP requests, routes, and middleware to communicate with the MongoDB database and serves data to the frontend.

### React

 React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently. In TimeFlow, React is used as the frontend library to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

## NodeJS

 Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and lightweight. In TimeFlow, Node.js serves as the backend runtime, handling server-side logic and communicating with the database via ExpressJS.
